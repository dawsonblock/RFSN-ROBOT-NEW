V8 Bug Fix Validation Tests
============================
Tests to validate the three critical bug fixes in harness.py:
1. MPC success path no longer incorrectly marks failure
2. No duplicate exception handlers
3. Timing metrics are accurate (MPC solve time, not full step time)

Also tests the practical improvements:
4. MPC planning cadence reduces computational load
5. Contact force feedback for impedance control
